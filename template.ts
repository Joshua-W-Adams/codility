/**
 * Problem Solving Methodology
 *
 * 1. Understand the problem
 *    Read twice if necessary
 *
 * 2. Break down the requirements
 *    Define inputs, outputs and any special output considerations
 *    Do a few basic examples
 *
 * 3. Define the assumptions
 *
 * 4. Write pseudocode
 *    Comment the high level steps directly in function signature
 *    DO NOT proceed until this is solved
 *    This is often referred to as "Breath First" coding
 *
 * 5. Consider options
 *
 * 6. Write Tests (TDD)
 *    Usually included in testing platform already
 *
 * 7. Code
 *    Directly in testing platform environment
 *    Avoids unecessary time lost due to writing test cases, function signatures and creating new files
 *
 * 8. Test and Debug
 *
 * 9. Review
 *    time complexity
 *    space complexity
 *
