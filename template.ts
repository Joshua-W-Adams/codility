/**
 * Problem Solving Methodology
 *
 * - Understand the problem
 *    Read twice if necessary
 *
 * - Break down the requirements
 *    Define inputs, outputs and any special output considerations
 *    Do a few basic examples
 *    Ask yourself. Are there any dependencies between inputs and results?
 *    Can these be descriped by algebra?
 *
 * - Pseudocode
 *    Comment the high level steps directly in function signature
 *    DO NOT proceed until this is solved
 *    This is often referred to as "Breath First" coding
 *
 * - Tests (TDD)
 *    Usually included in testing platform already
 *
 * - Code
 *
 * - Test and Debug
 *
 * - Review
 *    time complexity
 *    space complexity
 *    other more efficient solutions to problem
 *
